- C Programming
- C++ Programming (with Object-Oriented Concepts)
- Java Programming (Core + OOP)

## Topics Included
- Basic Input / Output
- Conditional Statements (if, else, switch)
- Loops (for, while, do-while)
- Functions / Methods
- Arrays and Strings
- Pattern Programs
- Logic Building Problem Sets
- Data Structures (Arrays, Stack, Queue, Linked List, etc.)

### *Note:*  
*Topics will be added as taught in class.*

## How to Compile and Run

### For C

gcc filename.c -o Myexe ./Myexe

### For C++

g++ filename.cpp -o Myexe ./Myexe

### For Java

javac filename.java 
java filename OR java filename.java

*More instructions will be added as taught in class.*

## Purpose of This Repository
- To maintain daily class work in an organized manner
- To improve programming logic and understanding
- To learn syntax and structure in multiple languages
- To prepare for practicals, tests, and viva

*More concepts will be added as taught in class.*
